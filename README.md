# recommendation-system-on-movies
A project to teach myself recommender systems. 

Created a simple sample dataset with user_id, item_id and the corresponding rating (interaction) given by the user to the item.

Implemented the following types of recommender systems:
1. Popular-based with IMDB weighted rating
2. Content-based with the genres feature
3. Affinity matrix (Collaborative filtering — Memory-based)
4. TruncatedSVD (Sklearn) (Collaborative filtering — Memory-based)
5. Funk MF (Surprise) (Collaborative filtering — Model-based)
6. GMF (Keras) (Collaborative filtering — Model-based)
